#### The Goal of this project is to deploy on our server simple copy of [AirBnB website](https://alx-intranet.hbtn.io/rltoken/m8g02HcD2ovrl_K-zulYBw).

### This is a complete web application composed by:
* A command interpreter to manipulate data without a visual interface, like in a Shell (perfect for development and debugging)
* A website (the front-end) that shows the final product to everybody: static and dynamic
* A database or files that store data (data = objects)
* An API that provides a communication interface between the front-end and your data (retrieve, create, delete, update them)
